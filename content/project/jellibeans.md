Jellibeans is a web search tool for assisting users with 
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 
The system models user interactions within the search process, utilising a user profile, and by integrating 
insights from the core features of the Autistic condition. 
The system has an integrated infra-red motion controlled user interface component, 
utilising gesture and hand movement data to enhance the interactive search process.
The work provides insights into how search can be improved for users on the Autistic spectrum and includes 
an analysis of experiments carried out with the system.
