If you have any ideas for a project that fits within my interests, then please feel free to come and discuss it with me.

I look to take on students who are intelligent (which you are by definition of being a Birkbeck student!) and who have an interest in the project that they are about to undertake. 
Students should be self-motivated to a degree and be keen to explore the topic. You should not be afraid to express your ideas and follow them. However, you need to be balanced in your 
approach and practice scientific practices in evaluating your own work. If you have the basics, we can work together to put together a good solid project.

I like to see students take control of the project and run with their ideas and thoughts. This means that students exercise a degree of independence - however, I don't expect this to 
translate to going off into a dark corner and never seeing me. My role is to provide some guidance and advice. There is clearly a conflict between these two expectations and so what we need 
to do is work together to strike a suitable balance between self-direction/independence and guidance/direction.
